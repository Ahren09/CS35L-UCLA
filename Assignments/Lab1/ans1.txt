1.man -k
I used the command "man man" to find the answer

2.
mv is in /usr/bin/mv
sh is in /usr/bin/sh
I use "which mv" and "which sh"
Alternatively, we can use "whereis mv" and "whereis sh"

3.
ar, pr and tr
I use find /usr/bin -executable -name ?r
to find all executable programs with 2 characters and end with "r"
I use "man ar" "man pr" and "man tr" to find their functionality

ar: create modify and extract from archives
pr: convert text for printing
tr: translate or delete characters

4.
/etc/alternatives/emacs
I first "cd /usr/bin" and "ls -l grep emacs" to examine files belonging to emacs. Then I see the symbolic link linking to the file above

5.
The version number is
gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-36)
I use "gcc --version"

6.
"chmod u+sx": sets user ID of the owner of the file on execution and add permission of execution
"s": set user or group ID
"x": permission of execution
"u": user who owns the file


"chmod o-w": remove writing permission of others
"o" means others
"w" means writing permission

7.I first "cd /usr/local/cs"
and "find / -type d -mtime 28"

8.
I use "find /usr/bin -type l" to find the names of commands
and "find /usr/bin -type l|wc" counts the number of lines, which is the same as the number of symbolic links

9.
I first "cd /usr/lib64" and "ls -lt" to find the oldest file
The file at the bottom without a 'd' is the oldest regular file:
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 root root       19408 Dec 28  2013 librom1394.so.0.3.0
The file's name is librom1394.so.0.3.0

10.
from "man locale" I found that locale gets its data from the environment variables that control the locale.

11.
There are two commands:
downcase-region
downcase-word
I used C-h a and typed "downcase"

12.
I used "C-h ?" and followed the hints:
I first "C-h b" and then "C-s". I typed "C-M-r" to search for description of "C-M-r" and read through all of these commands
C-M-r           isearch-backward-regexp
C-M-s           isearch-forward-regexp
C-M-t           transpose-sexps
C-M-u           backward-up-list
C-M-v           scroll-other-window

Then I use C-h k [COMMAND] to check the accurate functionality of each command
C-M-r:
Do incremental search backward for regular expression.

C-M-s:
Do incremental search forward for regular expression.

C-M-t:
transpose expression

C-M-u:
Move up in parenthesis structure

C-M-v:
Scroll other window up

13.
C-g cancels running or partially typed commands
I use "C-h k C-g" to find the answer

14.
The yank function reinserts functions killed previously and keeps the cursor at the end of inserted text
After starting emacs by typing e m a c s, I use "C-h r" to open the manual and "C-s yank" to search for explanation for the yank function

15.
In emacs, we use C-x d to invoke the dired command
The numbers of items found by the two commands are exactly the same. 
"dired" gives information about current and parent directory but ls -l does not
I use "C-h b" and "C-s dired" to find the command "C-x d",then I compared the results
