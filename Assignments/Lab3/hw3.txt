Q1.
The patch should improve performance since it solves the overriding
problem when we call "ls -aA" and "ls -Aa"
 Also it generates better display of directories

Q2.
We must pay extra attention scripts that incorporate "ls -aA" command since
the "-a" option is no longer overriden by "-A"
Concretely, scripts that incorporate traversal of directories (especially 
those involving recursive functions) must be examined more carefully.

Q3. 
When we call the randline command by:

python randline.py -n 1 /dev/null

It outputs error message:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is 
empty
IndexError: list index out of range

Error checking: "echo $?" outputs 1

This is because on Line 54, the script writes: 
if numlines <= 0:
        parser.error("negative count: {0}".
This means the function returns an error message only if 
number of lines in the file is smaller than 0. For files 
with 0 lines, the function will perform undefined behavior


Q4.
When we run the script with python3:

python3 randline.py -n 1 /dev/null

The program returns a syntax error:

File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This is because Python2 and Python3 have different syntax for
IOError

Correction:
If we change the line:
except IOError as (errno, strerror):

Into:
except IOError as err:

Running the .py file under Python3, the function will generate the same error 
messages as does in Python2.

##### Cases of shuf.py #####
shuf -i 1-9
shuf -i 9-1
shuf -i 1-1
shuf -i 1-5 -n 3 # print 3 numbers
shuf -i	1-5 -n 7 # print 5 numbers


#Consider file.txt with 5 lines
shuf -n 12 file.txt # print 5 lines
shuf -n 2 file.txt # print 2 lines


shuf -r file.txt #infinite number of lines
shuf -n 12 -r file.txt # print 12 lines
shuf -n 12 -r -i 1-5 # print 12 numbers
