We first examine whether the override Bug still exist
by running the ls -aA command on my home directory:

ls -aA ~

It generates result like:
.
..
.bash_history
.cache

exchanging the -a and -A command:
ls -Aa ~

Under both conditions, the current directory and home directory are 
in the output, which signifies that the overriding error exists

1.
By the following three commands, I download the Coreutils 8.29 source code,
the signature and keystring

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

2.
tar xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
The command is for unzipping the file into the directory "coreutils-8.29"
-x option is for unzipping
-J option is for zipping or unzipping .tar.xz files

3.
After entering the directory by "cd coreutils-8.29"
we run the following command to configure it to our "coreutils-install" for 
installation
./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/yiqiao/Lab3/coreutils-install

4.
We run the commands:

make
make install

to install the package in our "coreutils-install" directory

5.
Reproducing the bug

We first change our directory:
cd ~/Lab3/coreutils-install/bin

and run the two ls commands under en_US.UTF-8 locale:

ls -aA
ls -Aa

They still generate the same output with home and parent directories present:
.
..
.'['
.b2sum

6.

First we "cd coreutils-8.29" to reach the directory where we put files
 for installation.
We copy the patch into a file named myPatch.patch 
The file starts from "diff --git a/src/ls.c b/src/ls.c"
Then we run the patch command
patch -p1<myPatch.patch

It generates the following message:

patching file src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
patching file tests/local.mk
patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh

This signifies that patching of ls.c succeeds

7.
We perform the configure command again

./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/yiqiao/Lab3/coreutils-install

The configure command runs without error. But when we run "make" command
it generates error message:

/u/cs/ugrad/yiqiao/Lab3/coreutils-8.29-3/build-aux/missing: line 81: aclocal-
1.15: command not found

Since the configure command didn't work out, I check the manual for configure 
command and try the autoreconf command:
autoreconf -f -i
By reading "man autoreconf", I found that:
-f equals --force, consider all files obsolete
-i is --install, copy missing auxiliary files

The output is as follow:
Copying file build-aux/config.rpath
Copying file m4/extern-inline.m4
Copying file m4/glibc2.m4
Copying file m4/intdiv0.m4
Copying file m4/intl.m4
Copying file m4/intldir.m4
...

Then we perform:
make
make install

By applying the "echo $?" command,
we observe that the previous two command run without error

We perform the previous two commands
ls -aA

We find that . and .. are not displayed in the result
-A no longer overrides -a
The change was successful.

Since we do not have root permission, we cannot apply the new "ls" command
by copying it into /usr/bin/
