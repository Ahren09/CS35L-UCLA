1.
I first connect the Beaglebone to the lab wifi and ssh to it via:
ssh root@192.168.8.1

Since OpenSSH is already installed,
all I need is to install the xauth and xterm for later tasks:
apt-get install xauth
apt-get	install	xterm

2.
Set up a unique hostname for my board:
hostname ahren

"ahren" is the hostname I set

Create a new non-root user on my board:
useradd ahren

And change the password of the new user "ahren" by:
passwd ahren

Then a new user is created on my board.

I create a home directory for the new user before logging out from root:
mkdir /home/ahren

3.
I run "ifconfig" to get the ip address of my board, which will be used by my 
partner to log onto my board.

My ip address is 10.97.85.26 

By the same token, I get my partner Danny's ip address: 10.97.85.31

4.
Logging in without password

First I generate a key pair by:
ssh key-gen

To allow my partner log into my BBB, I create an ".ssh" directory 
cd /home/ahren
mkdir .ssh

I copy the generated key on my partner's host
On Danny's host:
ssh-copy-id -i ahren@10.97.85.26
I type yes for the poped up question and type in my password to log in
and exited.

I used "eval `ssh-agent`" to output the environment variables for connection
I use this command to copy the key:
ssh-add
I typed in the public key

Then I type "ssh ahren@10.97.85.26"
It does not require me to type in password for logging in

4.
Test SSH for Password Authentication

I log onto my partner's BBB through my host
ssh -X danny@10.97.85.31

then I typed xterm

An xterm shell window pops up

The steps also works on Danny's host
