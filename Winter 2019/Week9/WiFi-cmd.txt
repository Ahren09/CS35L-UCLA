If you have problems connecting to the lab wifi through the web page, 
you can also connect your board to the lab wifi through command lines:

Make sure you are logged into the BeagleBone as root and then do:

$connmanctl

Turn on the wifi for your BeagleBone:

connmanctl> enable wifi

Scan all available wifi access points:

connmanctl> scan wifi

List all the discovered access points:

connmanctl> services

The access point you will connect to will look something like this:

CR3760-wifi wifi_506583d4fc5e_544e434150413937414239_managed_psk

Register as the prospective client:

connmanctl> agent on

After you locate the access point you want to connect to, use the string next to the name of the access point as the input to the following command:

connmanctl> connect wifi_506583d4fc5e_544e434150413937414239_managed_psk

If the access point requires a wifi password, enter the password after "Passphrase?":

Passphrase? 3760ClassNet

Now you are connected to the wifi so close the application connmanctl:

connmanctl> quit
