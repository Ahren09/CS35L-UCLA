1. ssh command:
	ssh commands allow you to log into a remote machine via network

	e.g.
	
	ssh lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu 
	ssh 192.168.1.1 #specify remote machine by using its ip address

	By default, ssh will use your current user name to log into the 
	remote machine. 
	
	To specify a different user name, use @ or -l option
	
	e.g. 
	
	ssh zhou@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
	
	or 
	
	ssh lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu -l zhou
	
	
	-X option allows ssh to forward the graphics display of the remote machine.
	
	Use ssh -X to log into lnxsrv09 and then invokes emacs. 
	
	You should be able to see the GUI of emacs. 

2. scp command:

	scp commands are able to exchange files with remote machines. 
	
	scp command syntax:
	scp source destination

	scp zhou@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu:~/hw/foo /var/tmp/
	#copy the remote file ~/hw/foo on lnxsrv09 to the /var/tmp/ 
	directory of local computer
	
	scp /usr/bin/ls zhou@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu:/var/tmp 
	#copy the local file /usr/bin/ls to the /var/tmp/ directory of the 
	remote lnxsrv09 machine 
	
3. useradd command:
	create a user on the computer. 	Only root user can execute
	
	e.g.
	useradd foo  # adds a new user foo on the computer

4. passwd command:
	change the passwd of a user
	
	e.g.
	passwd #change the passwd for the current user

	passwd foo #change the passwd for user foo, only root can execute

5. chown command:
	change the owner of a file. Only root user can execute
	chown foo /var/tmp/bar 
	
6. hostname command
	
	Display the name of the machine
	
	hostname # shows the name of the machine
	
	hostname myMachine # changes the name of the machine to be myMachine, 
						 only root user can execute

7.	ssh login without passwd

	ssh-keygen # This command will generate the public/private key pair. 
			   # It will also ask for a passphrase to encrypt the private key. 
			   
	
	ssh-copy-id #This command copies the public key to the remote server
	
	e.g.
	
	ssh-copy-id user_name@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
	
	Now, if you do ssh user_name@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu, you will be prompted 
	to enter the passphase generated in ssh-keygen. 
	You will not need to enter your passwd on lnxsrv09. 
	
8. ssh agent

	A simple program to remember the passphrase of private keys for you
	
	To use it:
	eval `ssh-agent` #This command creates ssh-agent
	ssh-add 	     #This command will ask for your
					 passphrase and stores it in ssh agent 
					 
	After invoke SSH agent, you can log into the remote machine without 
	entering any password/passphrase at all. 
	
9. Complete command list to log in without using passwd:

	ssh-keygen 
	ssh-copy-id user_name@remote_server
	eval `ssh-agent`
	ssh-add 
	
	Now you should be able able to log into the remote_server as user_name 
	without using password/passphrase at all.
